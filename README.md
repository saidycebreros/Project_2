Portfolio Project 2A: EDA using the "Marketing Campaign" Dataset

In this project I explored a dataset from Kaggle named "Marketing Campaign" in MySQL Workbench. The overall goal of this project is to help a grocery store with their marketing strategy by analyzing their marketing campaign results and customer information. For part 2A of this project, we are looking at the objective "Boost gross revenue by 10% by January 30, 2023." The key performance indicators (KPIs) that will be used to measure progress towards this objective are customer segmentation metrics and customer retention metrics.

Summary of Steps:

First answered 3 questions for customer segmentation
* How many customers who accepted each campaign were married/have a partner?
* How many customers who accepted each campaign had children (< 18 years old)?
* What is the average income of customers who accepted each campaign?

Then looked at 3 questions for customer retention
* How many customers enrolled each month in 2013? 
* Is it taking too long for customers to purchase again? How many customers have not made a purchase in over 2 weeks? (10/01/2013 - 9/30/2014)
* Where are customers making the most purchases? (catalog, in-store, online)
